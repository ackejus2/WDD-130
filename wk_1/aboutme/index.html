            My name is Justin Ackerman, I grew up in Shelley, ID. I am a
            computer science major, minoring in Electrical Engineering
            getting a certificate in embedded systems. I think it would be
            very cool to work on embedded systems for drones or for other 
            aircraft as a career.

            I have been married for 3 years to my wife, Melissa, and we have a
             dog, named Ranger. We are also expecting a baby boy in January, so
             we are very excited for that part of our lives, and can't wait to
             see what comes!

            Lake City temple, in August 2019:
