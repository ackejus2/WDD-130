                Brigham Young University-Idaho was founded and is supported and 
                guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Its mission 
                 is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, 
                the Church, and their communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The university does this by:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Building testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and 
                fostering its principles in a wholesome academic, cultural, and social 
                environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Providing a high-quality education that prepares students 
                of diverse interests and abilities for lifelong learning and employment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Serving as many students as possible within resource constraints. 
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Delivering education that is affordable for students and the Church.
